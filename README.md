# Climbing Mount Everest: A Functional Adventure Far Far Away

<H3> Instructions on the Game: </H3>

1. The goal is to get to the summit of everest.
2. To win the game, you must pick up the flag at the south summit and bring it to everest.
3. An extra feature is that if you do not pick up the snacks in Camp 3 and the oxygen at ABC, you will die if you make it to the south summit, everest summit or lhotse summit.

A map of the game can be seen below -
